									<p class="intro-text serif">Now Leiter and Rocker are looking to go out on a high note at this year’s College World Series (tune-in info TK) before heading off to the majors next month when they can become only the second set of college pitcher teammates to go in the top five of the MLB draft, following Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer.</p>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">As a freshman with the 2019 season on the line against Duke in the super regionals, Rocker put on a performance for the ages, shutting down the Blue Devils with a 19-strikeout no-hitter. "In the 17 years I've been here, I don't think I've seen anything like that," Vanderbilt coach Tim Corbin told The Tennessean afterward.</figcaption>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">In his first career SEC start on March 20, Leiter walked the leadoff batter. He responded by retiring the next 27 South Carolina batters he faced, including 16 by strikeout. It was Vanderbilt's first regular-season no-hitter since 1971.</figcaption>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">In addition to Rocker's arsenal of power fastball and "disgusting" slider, in the words of his catcher, CJ Rodriguez, his competitiveness from Day 1 has set him apart."I saw a guy that just came out, and just said, 'This team's not losing,' Vandy pitching coach Scott Brown said. "I didn't see a guy that was out there thinking about just pitching and sequencing and my delivery. I just saw a guy that said, 'I'm going to take this ball, and I'm going to get you out with this pitch. And if it doesn't happen on this one, I'm going to get you out with this pitch, the next one.'"</figcaption>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">While Rocker's father was a star football player at Auburn and in the NFL, Leiter has the benefit of a dad, Al, who won 162 games and made two All-Star teams in the major leagues. "He's been around his dad for a while, and understands that, pitching maybe at a deeper layer than some guys that have come through at the age he's at, things some guys have gotten to that point," Brown says. Add in a power fastball and devastating curveball, and it's a recipe for success. </figcaption>

									<p class="body-text serif">Intro text for Leiter four-seam fastball - effortless delivery, near 100mph from small frame Leiter lead</p>
									<p class="body-text serif">This drill forces the quarterback to identify edge pressure while hitting the eject button to escape. Get out of trouble and keep the eyes up before climbing to throw from an unscripted platform. You see this from <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott" target="_new">Dak Prescott</a> -- check out <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/1079487665429532672" rel="noopener">this throw</a> -- who has perfected the art of manipulating pressure and throwing on the move. NFL prospects need to be able to do this too.</p>
									<p class="body-text serif">Give me a throw from an unstable platform, and let the quarterback drive the ball through the target. With this drill, we can grade the movement skills of the quarterbacks while testing their footwork and accuracy when they are asked to create as throwers when they begin to feel heat off the edge. Don't forget about that target -- this throw might look easy, but it's not. These are the types of unscripted throws that scouts would love to see in Indianapolis.</p>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">Leiter on his fastball: "I grip it pretty standard, with two fingers over the seams, but I am always very conscious of the width between my fingers. Dad has always said keep about a pencil’s width between the two fingers. I don’t have much grip on the bottom with the thumb at all. People always ask about the rising action my fastball has, and I think that has a lot to do with my lower release point. The pulldown from that lower point gives it that rising affect."</figcaption>

										<p class="body-text serif">Turn on the tape of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson" target="_new">Russell Wilson</a> or <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson" target="_new">Deshaun Watson</a>. These are two quarterbacks with the movement skills and moxie to wade through the wash and find that slice of daylight to extend the play with the eyes down the field. For receivers, this drill is about running an inside breaking route, then reacting to the quarterback's movement to settle in open space and creating a target for him to hit.</p>
										<p class="body-text serif">Put the quarterbacks in a position where they have to use a quick slide, then climb to shake interior pressure from a defensive tackle or blitzing linebacker. Had enough? Nope. Now they must bail outside the pocket before it swallows them up while looking up a target downfield and throwing on the move. Quarterbacks who escape trouble and buy extra seconds to keep the play alive are the architects of the explosive passing game in today's NFL.</p>

									<p class="body-text serif">Intro text on how Leiter is never rattled - stays in pitching stance when opponents step in/out of box. They must be able to diagnose and adapt to near-instant edge pressure at the snap or a defensive tackle like <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald" target="_new">Aaron Donald</a> winning his one-on-one and bursting up the field. And don't forget about the nickel corner who creates a free run at the QB from the slot. All of these scenarios come into play, and we don't see it in action at the combine. Let's change that here, with the quarterbacks climbing in the pocket to throw.</p>
									<p class="body-text serif">Think of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady" target="_new">Tom Brady</a> or <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees" target="_new">Drew Brees</a> on Sundays. The future Hall of Famers have mastered the subtle movements that allow them to slip pressure while creating a new throwing platform. And in this drill, we can simulate a pocket climb that puts the quarterback in a position to throw over the second level of the defense to hit the seam or skinny post.</p>
									<p class="body-text serif">While our first two drills showcased the movement skills synonymous with today's NFL quarterbacks, this quick climb again tests the quarterback with pressure while taking him off a static platform. And that gives scouts another look at a prospect's ability to win with footwork as a thrower.</p>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">Los Angeles Dodger RHP Walker Buehler: Buehler is seen as one of the dozen or so true aces in baseball and does it in the new school way: barely throwing a changeup while attacking the zone with plus-plus stuff. He sits in the mid-90's, working off of the en vogue, ""rising"" four seamer at the top of the strike zone to maximize whiffs and throws a mix of cutters/slider/curveballs, which all have their ideal location/situational use, roughly 40% of the time. Leiter only has two of those three pitches breaking pitches and his fastball command isn't as precise, but the size, delivery, and overall approach are very similar.</figcaption>

											<figcaption class="subhead alt small">Colorado Rockies RHP German Marquez: Marquez isn't a famous name due to playing in Colorado but he's probably the single best comp for what Rocker is most like right now. He's a workhorse that never quite broke through to true ace status, but hovered just below that, working off of a mid-90's four-seamer, slider and curveball, along with the occasional changeup, but never the triple-digit heat, league-leading K numbers, or Cy Young votes of the true dozen or so aces. That said, his consistency has helped him put up the 12th-most WAR among starting pitchers since 2018.</figcaption>
